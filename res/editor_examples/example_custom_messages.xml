        <text>I am most displeased.@L
        I ask you to give me a prosperous city, and what did you give me? A single palace and tent squalor as far as the eye can see.@L
        I expected defending legions and you gave me winding roads and lion tamers running marathons.@L
        I requested wheat and wine to test your industry, but you tore it down the day after.@P
        
        You shall find my favour hard to come by on your next assignment.@L
        I shall be watching closely.@P

        My dearest governor.@L
		My most beloved governor.@L
		I am most displeased... and my wrath is palpable.@L

        <text>My dearest governor.@L
        Did I not say I wish to see no sprawling slums in your city?@P
